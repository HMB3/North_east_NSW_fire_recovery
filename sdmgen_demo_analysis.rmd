The text and code below summarises a workflow in R that can be used to relatively rapidly assess the effect
of climate change on a species within Australia, from downloading occurrence records, through to creating
maps of predicted climatic suitability across Australia at 1km*1km resolution. An example of this work is 
published in Science of the Total Environment ::

### To install, run :

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## The package should important all the required packges
## Currently that's not working
devtools::install_github("HMB3/sdmgen")
library(sdmgen)

```


\


# STEP 1 :: Download species occurrence data
            

\

The backbone of the R workflow is a list of (taxonomically Ridgey Didge!) species names 
that we supply. The analysis is designed to process data for one species at a time, 
allowing species results to be updated as required. We can demonstrate the workflow 
using a sample of 10 plant species from the Stoten publication above. 


\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Use the first 10 plant species in the Stoten list
data("plant.spp")
analysis_spp <- plant.spp[1:10]
analysis_spp

```

\

First, we use two functions to download all species records from the Atlas and living Australia
(https://www.ala.org.au/) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, https://www.gbif.org/). 
It downloads the species data as individual .Rdata files to the specified folders, which must exist first, 
without returning anything. The functions are separated because the ALA and GBIF columns are slightly different, 
but both data sources are needed to properly quantify species ranges .

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## The functions expect these folders, create them if they don't exist
ALA_dir  <- './data/ALA'
GBIF_dir <- './data/GBIF'


## Create ALA subfolder
if(!dir.exists(ALA_dir)) {
            message('Creating MESS directory for ', species)
            dir.create(ALA_dir) } else {
              'ALA directory already exists'}


## Create GBIF subfolder
if(!dir.exists(GBIF_dir)) {
            message('Creating MESS directory for ', species)
            dir.create(GBIF_dir) } else {
              'GBIF directory already exists'}

```

\


```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Download GBIF occurrence data for each species
download_GBIF_all_species(species_list  = analysis_spp,
                          download_path = "./data/GBIF/",
                          download_limit = 20000)


## Download ALA occurrence data for each species
download_ALA_all_species(species_list  = analysis_spp,
                         your_email    = 'hugh.burley@gmail.com',
                         download_path = "./data/ALA/",
                         download_limit = 20000)

``` 

\

# STEP 2 :: Combine species occurrence data

\

The next function combines ALA and GBIF data, and filter to records on land, taken > 1950
The climate data (i.e. raster) used can be any worldclim layer.

\

First, get some global climate data from worldclim

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Download global raster for minimum temperature 
##worldclim_annual_temp <- raster::getData('worldclim', var='bio', res = 2.5)
worldclim_annual_temp <- raster::stack("./wc2-5/bio1.bil")
sp::plot(worldclim_annual_temp)

``` 

\

Then trim the occurrence records to those inside the raster boundaries (i.e. species records in the ocean
according to the Raster boundaries will be excluded)

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Combine ALA data, and filter to records on land taken > 1950
## The climate data is the worldclim version 1.0
ALA.LAND = combine_ala_records(species_list      = analysis_spp,
                               records_path      = "./data/ALA/",
                               records_extension = "_ALA_records.RData",
                               record_type       = "ALA",
                               keep_cols         = ALA_keep,
                               world_raster      = worldclim_annual_temp)


## Combine GBIF data and filter to records on land taken > 1950
GBIF.LAND = combine_gbif_records(species_list      = analysis_spp,
                                 records_path      = "./data/GBIF/",
                                 records_extension = "_GBIF_records.RData",
                                 record_type       = "GBIF",
                                 keep_cols         = gbif_keep,
                                 world_raster      = worldclim_annual_temp)

``` 

\

# STEP 3 :: extract environmental values

\

The next function combines occurrence files from ALA and GBIF into one table, and extracts enviro values.
It assumes that both files come from the combine_ala_records and combine_gbif_records functions.


```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Combine GBIF and ALA data, and extract environmental values
COMBO.RASTER.CONVERT = combine_records_extract(ala_df          = ALA.LAND,
                                               gbif_df         = GBIF.LAND,
                                               urban_df        = 'NONE',
                                               thin_records    = TRUE,
                                               template_raster = worldclim_annual_temp, #template.raster.1km.84,
                                               world_raster    = worldclim_2_5,
                                               projection      = CRS("+init=epsg:4326"),
                                               species_list    = analysis_spp,
                                               biocl_vars      = bioclim_variables,
                                               env_vars        = env_variables,
                                               worldclim_grids = "TRUE",
                                               save_data       = "FALSE",
                                               save_run        = "TEST_BATS")

\

When assessing the impacts of climate change, it is more robust to use projections from multiple climate 
models (IPCC, 2014; Taylor, Stouffer, & Meehl, 2011; Beaumont et al. 2007, Baumgartner et al 2018). We 
utilised a subset of six models recommended by CSIRO's Climate Change in Australia report 
(https://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au/en/), as these models were shown to perform better than others 
in their ability to simulate historical Australian climate. Hence, more confidence can be placed 
in their projections of future climate. For each of these six GCMs, we downloaded monthly maximum and 
minimum temperature and monthly precipitation from CSIRO for 2030, 2050 and 2070, at a spatial resolution 
of 30 arc-seconds (~1 km). From these data, we calculated the eight bioclimatic variables for the three 
time periods and re-projected the data to an equal area grid of 1 km x 1 km resolution to match the baseline 
climate, using R [version 3.4.2, R Core Team (2017)]. 

\


## **Modeling approach**
We modelled climatic suitability under current conditions (1960-1990) using the Maxent algorithm 
(Elith et al. 2011; Phillips et al. 2006; Phillips and Dudik 2008) within the Dismo R package 
(Hijmans et al. 2016). Maxent is a machine learning, correlative approach to modelling climatic suitability 
that is generally regarded as superior to other algorithms that are used to model presence-only 
occurrence data (Elith et al. 2006). Models were calibrated using most of the default Maxent settings, 
although hinge and threshold ‘features’ [mathematical transformations/simplifications of predictor variables, 
Elith et al., 2011] were disabled to reduce over-fitting the models. In addition to occurrence records, 
Maxent requires ‘background’ data that characterise the surrounding environment in which the modelled 
species occurs. Our background points comprised random samples of up to 70,000 cells from the pool of 
cells that (a) contained occurrence records in ALA for one or more plant species, (b) fell within 200 km 
of records for the target species[i.e. a buffered target-group background, Elith and Leathwick, 2007;Phillips 
and Dudík, 2008], and (c) were within the same Köppen climate zone as the modelled species' known 
occurrences [using the Köppen classification from Kriticos et al., 2012]. This approach was utilised to
ensure that both the occurrence and background points had similar spatial
biases, a key requirement for improving Maxent model calibration.

\

To run models for all species in the list, we created a function in the R programming language which splits 
a table of all species records * environmental conditions (the outcome of R scripts 1-6) into only those 
spatial records for a given species, and calibrates a Maxent model under current climate for that species.
The background points in this function are simply any record in the maxent table which is not the species
being modelled. This means the maxent table must be large for a big list of taxa (e.g plants and animals).
This is a limitation of the current workflow, but is suitable for processing smaller sets of species
(i.e. several hundred, or a few thousand).

\

This function runs two maxent models :: one using all the predictor variables supplied, and one which uses 
variance inflation factors (VIF) to run backwards selection on the full model. Given a candidate set of predictor 
variables (e.g. climate, soil, etc.) , this function identifies a subset that meets specified multicollinearity 
criteria. Subsequently, backward stepwise variable selection (VIF) is used to iteratively drop the variable that 
contributes least to the model, until the contribution of each variable meets a specified minimum, or until 
a predetermined minimum number of predictors remains. While this function is memory intensive, it is very useful 
to screen a large number of potentially useful but strongly correlated GIS layers (e.g. interpolated layers 
which are all based on similar input data, such as digital elevation models, meteorological stations or soil samples).


```{r run maxent, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}




```

\


```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}



```

\

The performance of each model was estimated by calculating the average Area Under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic curve (Swets,1988) and the True Skill Statistic (TSS) on test data through five-fold
cross-validation. This involved splitting the occurrence data for each species into five random subsets 
of close to equal size (i.e. folds), fitting the model to four of the five folds and predicting to the fifth. 
This process was repeated until each fold was used four times for model fitting and once for model evaluation 
(Stone, 1974, see plot and table below for example species). Subsequently, CSMs were fitted a final time using 
the complete set of species data. It is important to emphasize that models can have high performance indicators 
with respect to test/training data, yet still over-project suitability (i.e. although the model projects some 
cells to be suitable, given ecological knowledge of the species these cells are unlikely to be suitable in reality). 
This may indicate that models are encountering novel conditions. To explore this, we calculated Multivariate 
Environmental Similarity Surfaces [MESS, Elith et al., 2010; Baumgartner et al. (2017)]. Although MESS maps indicated 
that the models were not projecting to novel states for individual variables, this approach does not consider 
novel combinations of variables. An alternate explanation for over-projection is that suitable conditions 
for the species are influenced by environmental variables not considered in the model [such as edaphic 
conditions, see Barry and Elith, 2006]. 

\

```{r maxent table, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
source('./R/COLLATE_MAXENT_KATANA_RESULTS.R',   echo = FALSE)
kable(head(MAXENT.RESULTS[1:3, 10:15], 10))

```

\

As such, we visually assessed all maps of current suitable habitat (e.g. Fig 2), and excluded from our analysis models 
whose resulting maps contained substantial over projection.Although this approach is somewhat subjective, 
excluding questionable models in this way adds more rigour to our analysis than if we were to rely solely 
on AUC and TSS values. This expert validation procedure suggested that for 72 species, additional/alternative 
climate variables (beyond the readily available bioclimatic variables)may be required in order to adequately 
characterise the species' realised climate niche. Hence, the following results are based on data for the 
remaining 176 species with robust models only. The CSM for each of these species was projected onto the 
six climate scenarios for two future time periods (2030 and 2070), using the project function in the rmaxent 
package [https://github.com/johnbaums/rmaxent; Baumgartner et al., 2017].

\


## **Projecting the models to future scenarios**
We then created a function to take the maxent model for each species, and project it onto the six chosen 
climate scenarios for three future time periods (2030, 2050 and 2070), using the 'Rmaxent' package.
This function loops over all 6 climate scenarios for each species analysed, one period at a time 
(2030/50/70).

\

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}



```

\

This function also runs Multivariate environmental similarity (MESS) maps for each species. MESS maps measure 
the similarity between the new environments, and those in the training sample. When model predictions are 
projected into regions, times or spatial resolutions not analysed in the training data, it is important 
to measure the similarity between the new environments, and those in the training sample (Elith et al. 2010), 
as models are unreliable when predicting outside their domain (Barbosa et al. 2009). This process is 
especially important for interpreting the results for taxa which have been reliably recorded across large 
geographic and environmental ranges (e.g. for plant species that have wide distributions both in their 
country of 'origin', and throughout the world).

\

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}


```

\


## **Summarising change in climatic suitability** 
The maps generated by the function illustrate how climatic suitability varies across the landscape. 
In these maps, a grid cell is given a probability value between 0 (highly unsuitable) and 1 (highly suitable). 
Using a species-specific threshold – the 10th percentile training presence logistic threshold – based on the 
weighting of different model errors (‘commission’ errors, where a grid cell is classified as suitable when 
it is not, versus ‘omission’ errors, where a grid cell is classified as unsuitable when it is suitable) 
the maps were converted into binary representations of regions that are less or more suitable (0 or 1). 
Henceforth, we refer to these regions as ‘no to low suitability’ and ‘suitable’ regions, respectively. 
This terminology more clearly articulates the subjective nature of threshold selection.

**Figure 2.** Example of a continuous climatic suitability map for one plant species under 
current conditions. Species occurrence points are plotted in red on the left panel. The cells in the right 
panel are coded from 0 : no to low suitability, to 1 : highly suitable. The shaded areas on the right panel
indicate where the maxent model is extrapolating beyond the training data (i.e. the result of a MESS map).

\

To combine the maps for each climate scenario, we then created a function to overlay and sum maps for all six 
scenarios, such that the value of a grid cell in the combined map could range from 0 (no to low suitability in 
all climate scenarios) to 6 (suitable in all climate scenarios). This function loops over three lists : a list 
of directories containing the maps, a list of species, and a list of maxent thresholds for all species analysed
(i.e. the climatic suitability maps below which species are not considered to occur in a grid cell).

\

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}


```

\

The combined maps were then re-coded to indicate whether grid cells were classified as suitable 
in the majority of climate scenarios (i.e. at least four of the six scenarios). These grid cells 
are most likely to be climatically suitable for the modelled species in the future. We then 
calculated percent changes to the size of suitable climate in terms of 
(i) overall change in size, 
(ii) loss of baseline suitable areas and (iii) gain of newly suitable areas. 

\

The function also intersects species' maps with Significant Urban Areas (SUAs) from the 2016 ABS Australian Census. 
It calculates the area predicted to be climatically suitable within the 82 temperature SUAs under current climate, 
and the extent to which this area may change under the future scenarios. Preliminary analyses demonstrated 
that environmental space tends to be poorly characterised by Maxent background samples in arid/tropical 
SUAs, further justifying the exclusion of these SUAs from results.


```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}



```

**Figure 3.** Example of a combined map of change in climatic suitability from current conditions to 2070. 
Species occurrence points are plotted in red on the left panel. The cells in the right and bottom panels 
are coded as either lost (orange cells - present now but not in 2070 according to 4 or more GCMs), 
gained (green cells - absent now, but present in 2070), stable (blue cells - present now and in 2070), 
or never suitable (white cells - never present). 

\


Finally, we fitted generalised additive models (GAMs) to assess the relationship between both the mean 
annual temperature, and the maximum temperature of the warmest month (1960–1990) within an SUA
– averaged across grid cells – and (a) the percent of species lost (i.e. percent of species with suitable 
climate within the SUA during the baseline, that lacked suitable climate in the future) and gained 
(i.e. percent of species with suitable climate within the SUA in the future, but not during the baseline) 
and (b) the percent of the SUA's area that changed over time from (i) unsuitable to suitable or (ii) 
suitable to unsuitable averaged over all species. We used the mgcv R package [version 1.8.4, Wood, 2011; 
R Core Team, 2018] to fit GAMs, using a restricted maximum likelihood approach (i.e. REML). Note that 
we also fitted GAMs using annual precipitation (see Figs. S2–S5 in supporting information)
but the relationships show no pattern.

### **Climatically suitable habitat for horticultural tree species** 

Models for all 176 species had AUC and TSS values sufficiently high to indicate acceptable predictive 
power [median AUC = 0.869 (±0.6)and median TSS=0.6 (±0.09), see Table S1 in supplementary material,
Swets, 1988]. Overall, the spatial extent of climatically suitable habitat is predicted to decline 
from an average of 16,152 km2 (±9082 km2) in the baseline period to 13,043 km2 (±8924 km2) by 2030, 
and 12,300 km2(±,016 km2) by 2070. Of the 176 species, 73% are predicted to experience declines in 
the extent of climatically suitable habitat across their respective SUAs: 18% are predicted to lose N50% 
of this habitat by 2030, while 34% are predicted to lose N50% by 2070. Fourteen species(8%) were 
projected to have losses exceeding 90% of baseline climatically suitable habitat [e.g. Callitris oblonga 
(Pygmy cypress pine) and Acacia fimbriata (Brisbane golden wattle)]. In contrast, 11 species are predicted 
to experience increases in the extent of climatically suitable habitat of 50%, e.g. Ficus platypoda 
(Rock fig) and Brachychiton rupestris (Queensland bottle tree). Generally, suitable habitat is predicted 
to shift poleward. As such, species are likely to experience an extension of their southern (colder) 
range margin (e.g. Pongamia pinnata and Melia azedarach in Fig. 4), and/or a contraction of their 
northern (warmer) margin (e.g. Melia azedarach and Syzygium smithii in Fig. 4). However, some species – 
particularly those found along coastal regions of southeast Australia – may experience contraction at 
both range margins(see Syzygium smithii, Fig. 2).

## **Climatically suitable habitat for tree species within urban areas** 

SUAs were predicted to contain suitable climate for between 10 and 139 of the 176 species for the baseline 
period,with an average of 74 species(±30). By 2070, this average is predicted to decline to 63 species 
(±30) per SUA, with ten SUAs (eight in eastern Queensland and two in south-west Western Australia) predicted 
to have suitable climate for 50% fewer species (Fig. 5). However, 21 of the 82 SUAs may contain suitable
climate for more species by 2070, than during the baseline period, including Orange in NSW (50% more species), 
Wangaratta in Victoria(25%), and all five of the Tasmanian SUAs in this study (6–24%). Note that these SUAs 
predominantly occur in cooler regions.

**Figure 5.** Scatter plots of projected changes to the climatically suitable habitat of 176 commercial 
native Australian tree species within 82 of Australia's Significant Urban Areas (SUAs) (y axis)
vs. current mean annual temperature of the SUA (x axis, a-d), and maximum temperature of the warmest month 
(MAXT, e–h), for 2030 (lighter points) and 2070 (darker points). Panels a,b, e and f show the number 
of species, within each SUA, for which climatically suitable habitat is absent under baseline conditions, 
but present in the future (grey=2030, black=2070), expressed as a proportion of the number of species with 
suitable conditions in the baseline (i.e. species ‘gained’). Panels c, d, g and h show the proportion of 
species within each SUA with suitable habitat under baseline conditions, that do not have suitable habitat 
in the future (i.e. species ‘lost’). The left panels are for all 82 SUAs, while the right panels are for 
the SUAs with area > 200 km2 and with population > 80,000. DE = deviance explained from generalised additive 
models (GAMs) of species gain/loss (y axis) in each SUA vs. the SUA MAXT (x axis).

\

In general, the spatial extent of climatically suitable habitat across SUAs was predicted to decline for the 
176 species analysed. That is, averaged across their representative species, 12.3% (±5.8%) of each SUA's
currently suitable area will no longer be suitable by 2070, although predicted gains of 6.3% (±4.3%) occur 
elsewhere within the SUA. SUAswith warmer baseline mean annual temperatures are predicted to have fewer tree 
species that experience increases in the spatial extent of suitable habitat, compared to cooler SUAs (Fig. 4). 
Similarly, the percentage of tree species predicted to experience losses in suitable habitat is
greater in warmer SUAs (e.g. 80% in Rockhampton, Queensland) than in cooler SUAs (e.g. 13% in Burnie, Tasmania). 
These patterns of change were consistent regardless of the area and population of the SUAs (Fig. 4).

**Figure 6.** Scatter plots of changes to the percent of species with climatically suitable habitat within 
82 of Australia's Significant Urban Areas (SUAs) (y axis) vs. current mean annual temperature of the SUA 
(x axis, a–d), and maximum temperature of the warmest month (MAXT, e–h), for 2030 (lighter points) and 
2070 (darker points). ‘Range gained’ refers to the proportion of species in the future time period projected 
to experience a net increase in the spatial extent of suitable habitat within that SUA vs. baseline, while 
‘Range loss’ refers to the proportion of species projected to experience a net decrease in spatial extent 
of suitable habitat within that SUA. The left panels are for all 82 SUAs, while the right panels are for 
the SUAs with area > 200 km2 and with human population > 80,000. Deviance = deviance explained by generalised 
additive models (GAMs) of species range gain/loss (y axis) in each SUA vs. the SUA MAT/MAXT.

\

SUAs with warmer baseline mean annual temperature are predicted to have fewer tree species experience 
increases in suitable habitat compared to cooler SUAs (Fig. 6). Similarly, the percent of tree species 
predicted to experience losses in suitable habitat increases with increasing mean annual temperature 
within SUAs. These patterns of change were consistent regardless of the area and population of the SUAs 
(Fig. 6). In addition, the deviance explained by GAMs in the long term (2070) was higher than the model 
deviance in the short term (2030).

**Figure 7.** Based on predictions from a climate suitability model, barplots illustrate the percentage of 
native tree species with suitable habitat in the baseline period (1960-1990), that are predicted to experience 
gains (green) or losses (red) in the extent of suitable habitat over 82 Significant Urban Areas (SUA, left 
panels), and within the 19 largest SUAs (right panels), for 2030 (a-b) and 2070 (c-d). SUAs are ranked by 
current mean annual temperature (MAT, e.g. Hobart is the coolest SUA, Mackay the the warmest)

Climate suitability models (CSMs) for 176 commonly-planted, native Australian tree species show that 
climate change will likely reduce climatically suitable habitat within the majority of the 82 temperate and
subtropical urban areas included in this study. Patterns in the loss of climatically suitable habitat for 
urban species are broadly similar for predictions for plant species in natural ecosystems. That is, suitable
habitat for urban trees is generally contracting, and shifting polewards, similar to trends in natural 
populations [e.g. Hickling et al.,2006; O'Donnell et al., 2012; Butt et al., 2013]. This overarching pattern
is driven by the projection of a poleward shift in climate space in the underlying climate models: hence, 
generally within temperate and subtropical regions, species' low-latitude (here, northernmost) range margins 
are predicted to contract, while their high-latitude (southernmost) margins may extend into new areas.

\

Predicted shifts in climatically suitable habitat mean that urban areas in cooler regions (for example, 
the city of Orange in central westernNewSouthWales, and the city of Launceston in northern Tasmania),
are likely to experience smaller reductions in the number of species with suitable habitat than urban areas 
in warmer regions (such as the cities of Mackay and Brisbane in Queensland) (Fig. 8). This predicted
broad pattern of decreasing habitat along a gradient of increasing temperature supports previous studies 
based on realised climate niches(Jenerette et al., 2016; Kendal et al., 2018), which also demonstrated
that temperature is a key filter on trees in urban environments. Hence our results, combined with those 
of other studies quantifying climate niches of species (Jenerette et al., 2016; Kendal et al., 2018; McBride
and Laćan, 2018) indicate that a substantial proportion of the most common urban trees face climate change 
risks where they are currently planted.

State and Territory (Ade = Adelaide, Bris = Brisbane, Can = Canberra, Hob = Hobart, 
Mel = Melbourne; Per = Perth, Syd = Sydney - The Northern Territory was not included 
in this study, Australia’s temperate SUAs are plotted in pink). For each largest SUA, 
we plot the predicted change in average % of cells lost (orange), gained (green) and 
stable (light blue) in each SUA across all 176 species according to our climate 
suitability models, from baseline to 2070.

\

As with all CSM studies, it is important to highlight several key caveats. Firstly, due to the availability 
of quality occurrence and tree inventory data in eastern Australia, the majority of the 176 tree species
we modelled are temperate (e.g. Syzygium smithii, see Appendix, Table S2). It is possible that the responses 
of trees planted within tropical and sub-tropical SUAs may drive overall patterns of species turnover
in the warm temperate SUAs included in our study (e.g. city of Rockhampton in Queensland). Secondly, we 
have only considered macro-climatic variables in our CSMs. Clearly, other factors – from microclimate,
extreme weather events and edaphic conditions, to phenotypic plasticity [e.g. Singer et al., 2016; 
Senner et al., 2018; (Benito Garzon et al., 2019)] – will also influence the suitability of urban areas 
for particular species. 

\

Thirdly, the ability to adjust otherwise limiting variables, such as rainfall through the use of 
irrigation (Moore, 2016; Vogt et al., 2017), may enable some species to survive in urban areas
that CSMs suggest are unsuitable (e.g. espaliered fruit trees). Locations characterised by contractions 
in the range of climatically suitable habitat predicted here may also be able to support urban species 
via additional watering or provision of shade, and our findings can assist in identifying regions 
which may require new maintenance regimes in the future. Revised maintenance requirements are just 
one response to climate change in urbanised areas, and below we discuss further implications
for urban planning.

## **Conclusions** 
The number of current horticultural tree species with suitable climate within Australia's SUAs 
is predicted to progressively decline as climate change intensifies, with more pronounced 
reductions in urban areas which are currently warmest. Our results show that climatic
‘opportunities’ for species differ markedly across the Australian continent, indicating 
that a proactive approach is needed to identify new climate-ready species and plantings for climate
change. The climate suitability model outputs we present provide a useful baseline assessment 
of the impact of climate change on urban tree species, but should not be used in isolation 
for urban forestry and planning. We advocate for an approach that combines multiple lines 
of evidence to assess plant responses to climatic factors, particularly to shorter-term extreme 
events – including measurements from plant traits and physiological experiments. 
Combinatorial/synthetic approaches like this promote a more holistic understanding of the 
resilience of urban plants and trees to climate change.
